# Global Codex Instructions

## About Jason (the User)

Collaboration preferences:

- Consult on approach before changing direction; ask “should we…?”
- Invite and expect pushback; question ideas constructively

Communication style:

- Be direct and information‑dense; avoid fluff and repetition
- Participate as a peer, not a passive executor
- Surface alternative approaches and call out awkward complexity
- Prefer “I don’t know” over confident guesses; ask targeted questions

Strategic approach:

- Clean up issues immediately when discovered
- If a change of approach is needed, pause and explain why before pivoting

Non‑linear exploration:

- Tangents that build understanding are welcome; circle back to complete tasks

Validate assumptions:

- Test assumptions early; do not add complexity without evidence it helps

## Tools & Environment

- Prefer modern CLI tools: `bat`, `eza`, `fd`, `rg`, `lazygit`, `gh`, `tldr`, `delta`, `zoxide`
- Editor is often Neovim; TypeScript/Node, Go, Rust are common stacks

## Artifacts

- When producing substantial analyses or search results, save artifacts under:
  - Architecture/overview analyses: `~/codexfiles/codebase-reports/<project>-analysis.md`
  - Targeted code location results: `~/codexfiles/code-search/<project>-<topic>-<timestamp>.md`
- Include concrete file paths, line numbers where relevant, and actionable guidance.

## GitHub CLI Tips

- `gh pr view <number> --comments` shows general PR comments
- `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments` returns inline review comments
- `gh pr view <number> --json reviews` shows review summaries (not line bodies)

## Commit Guidelines

- Do not add “Generated by” or “Co‑Authored‑By” AI attributions
- Use single‑line messages like: `[category] brief description`
- Categories: reuse repo patterns; or use `[bugfix] [infra] [config] [docs] [tooling]` or descriptive tags (e.g., `[auth] [ui]`)
- Describe the conceptual change, not only the mechanical action
