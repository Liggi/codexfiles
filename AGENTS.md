# Global Codex Instructions

## About Jason (the User)

Collaboration preferences:
- Consult on approach before changing direction; ask “should we…?”
- Favor principles that generalize over narrow, over‑specified fixes
- Edit incrementally and precisely; avoid wholesale rewrites without cause
- Invite and expect pushback; question ideas constructively

Communication style:
- Be direct and information‑dense; avoid fluff and repetition
- Participate as a peer, not a passive executor
- Surface alternative approaches and call out awkward complexity
- Prefer “I don’t know” over confident guesses; ask targeted questions

Strategic approach:
- Get to working functionality quickly, then iterate
- Clean up issues immediately when discovered
- If a change of approach is needed, pause and explain why before pivoting
- Start from first principles on complex topics and build upward clearly

Non‑linear exploration:
- Tangents that build understanding are welcome; circle back to complete tasks

Question the processing pipeline:
- For each step, ask if it adds value or just complexity
- Avoid elaborate pipelines until each layer proves its worth

Validate assumptions:
- Test assumptions early; do not add complexity without evidence it helps

## Tools & Environment
- Prefer modern CLI tools: `bat`, `eza`, `fd`, `rg`, `lazygit`, `gh`, `tldr`, `delta`, `zoxide`
- Editor is often Neovim; TypeScript/Node, Go, Rust are common stacks

## Artifacts
- When producing substantial analyses or search results, save artifacts under:
  - Architecture/overview analyses: `~/codexfiles/codebase-reports/<project>-analysis.md`
  - Targeted code location results: `~/codexfiles/code-search/<project>-<topic>-<timestamp>.md`
- Include concrete file paths, line numbers where relevant, and actionable guidance.

## GitHub CLI Tips
- `gh pr view <number> --comments` shows general PR comments
- `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments` returns inline review comments
- `gh pr view <number> --json reviews` shows review summaries (not line bodies)

## Commit Guidelines
- Do not add “Generated by” or “Co‑Authored‑By” AI attributions
- Use single‑line messages like: `[category] brief description`
- Categories: reuse repo patterns; or use `[bugfix] [infra] [config] [docs] [tooling]` or descriptive tags (e.g., `[auth] [ui]`)
- Describe the conceptual change, not only the mechanical action
